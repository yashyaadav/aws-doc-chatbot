# Agentic AWS Documentation Chatbot

[![CI](https://github.com/yashyaadav/aws-doc-chatbot/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/yashyaadav/aws-doc-chatbot/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
&nbsp;**100% Terraform** · 31 AWS resources · `terraform plan` = no drift

A serverless chatbot that answers AWS questions in natural language by **reasoning over the
live AWS documentation**. A Claude agent on Amazon Bedrock (Sonnet 4.6 by default on the deployed
path for latency; Opus 4.8 is a one-variable swap) calls the official
[awslabs AWS Documentation MCP server](https://github.com/awslabs/mcp) as a tool — it searches
and reads real AWS docs at query time and answers **with citations**, rather than relying on the
model's training memory. Everything is Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform).

```

## Features

- **Answers grounded in live AWS docs, with citations** — every reply is built from pages the agent
  fetched at query time (via the AWS-Docs MCP server) and ends with the source URLs, not the model's
  training memory.
- **Genuinely agentic** — Claude decides when to `search_documentation` / `read_documentation` and
  iterates; the tool calls are visible in CloudWatch (proof it isn't answering from memory).
- **AWS-scoped & safe** — a Bedrock Guardrail keeps it on AWS topics, filters unsafe content /
  prompt-injection, and redacts PII on every invocation.
- **Polished chat UI** — dark, AWS-accented interface with message bubbles, a "thinking" indicator,
  and client-side **markdown rendering** (code blocks, inline code, auto-linked citations).
- **Multi-turn memory that survives refresh** — history is persisted in DynamoDB per session and
  rehydrated on page load; a **New chat** button starts a fresh session.
- **Authenticated** — Cognito Hosted UI login; the JWT is verified in-handler before the agent runs.
- **Latency-guarded** — Sonnet 4.6 with a hard cap of 3 tool calls/turn and token limits keep
  answers within the deployed timeout (Opus 4.8 is a one-variable swap).
- **100% Infrastructure-as-Code** — Terraform provisions every resource (ECR, Lambda, API Gateway,
  CloudFront, Cognito, DynamoDB, Guardrail, IAM, observability) with GitHub Actions CI.

## Try the live demo

- **URL:** https://d47xudcf1qjnj.cloudfront.net  (AWS account 315311531132 / us-east-1)
- **Sign in:** click **Log in** → Cognito Hosted UI → use the demo account:
  - **Username:** `demo@example.com`
  - **Password:** _shared separately with the assignment submission_ (kept out of this public repo)
- **Ask something AWS:** answers stream back with **clickable `docs.aws.amazon.com` citations**, e.g.
  - _"How do I enable S3 bucket versioning with the AWS CLI?"_
  - _"What's the difference between an IAM role and an IAM user?"_
  - _"How do I set a Lambda function's timeout in Terraform?"_
- **Watch the guardrail:** ask something off-topic (_"What stock should I buy?"_) and the Bedrock
  guardrail replies _"I can only help with Amazon Web Services questions."_ — proof answers are
  scoped to AWS, not the model free-styling.

> Sessions are per-browser (a `session_id` in `localStorage`), so the bot remembers earlier turns in
> the same conversation. **Log out** clears the token; use it to test the auth flow.

> **Ingress note:** the design targets a streaming **Lambda Function URL** (no API Gateway 29s cap).
> The shared exam account blocks Function URL invocation via an org guardrail, so the deployed path
> uses **API Gateway** (buffered, 30s cap) instead. The Function URL design is preferred in an
> unrestricted account; both are in the Terraform (the `apigw` module is the active ingress).

### Performance & known tradeoffs
- **Latency:** warm answers stream back in ~2–20s. The **first request after idle is ~15s** (container
  Lambda cold start — heavy `strands`/`boto3` imports exceed the 10s init window); subsequent replies
  are fast.
- **The 30s cap is a hard limit.** API Gateway **HTTP APIs** cap the integration timeout at 30s and it
  **cannot be raised** (a REST API could be quota-increased above 29s, but the streaming Function URL —
  blocked here — is the better fix). To stay within it: Sonnet 4.6, a 3-tool-call cap, and token limits.
- **Graceful overrun handling.** If a turn still exceeds 30s (e.g. cold start + a multi-step question),
  the agent finishes server-side and the turn is **persisted to DynamoDB**; the UI then **auto-fetches
  the saved answer from `/api/history`** instead of failing — no manual refresh.
- **Provisioned concurrency is deliberately omitted** to avoid standing cost in this demo account. Adding
  it (or, in an unrestricted account, the streaming Function URL) would eliminate the cold start entirely.

## Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

**Every AWS resource is defined in Terraform — nothing was created by hand in the console.** The live
stack is **31 resources** across 8 composable modules, with its own S3 state backend + DynamoDB lock;
`terraform plan` against production reports **no drift**.

| Module (`infra/modules/`) | Provisions |
| --- | --- |
| `ecr`            | Container registry + lifecycle policy for the Lambda image |
| `lambda`         | Container Lambda + **least-privilege IAM role** (Bedrock invoke, the one guardrail, the one DynamoDB table, logs, X-Ray) |
| `apigw`          | HTTP API → Lambda proxy integration (the active ingress) |
| `frontend`       | Private S3 bucket (OAC) + **CloudFront** (static UI + `/api/*` proxy) |
| `cognito`        | User pool, app client, Hosted-UI domain, reproducible demo user |
| `dynamodb`       | Conversation-history table (on-demand, TTL) |
| `guardrail`      | **Bedrock Guardrail** (topic / content / PII policies) + published version |
| `observability`  | CloudWatch dashboard, Lambda-error alarm, AWS Budgets alarm |

```bash
make tf-init      # init backend (own bucket yy-awsdocs-tfstate-*, lock table yy-awsdocs-tflock)
make tf-plan      # review (currently: no changes)
make tf-apply     # provision / update everything
make tf-destroy   # tear it all down
```

`envs/dev/` wires the modules together; `versions.tf` pins the AWS provider and the remote backend.
GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `terraform fmt -check` + `validate` on every PR, and
`deploy.yml` automates build/push/apply via GitHub OIDC. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full rationale.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full design, request flow, and
alternatives considered.

## Why this design
- **Live docs, not stale RAG** — the AWS-Docs MCP server fetches current documentation per query;
  no ingestion pipeline to build or keep fresh.
- **Genuinely agentic** — the model decides when to `search_documentation` / `read_documentation`
  and iterates; tool calls are visible in logs (proof it isn't answering from memory).
- **Production-grade serverless** — CloudFront + API Gateway + container Lambda, Cognito auth,
  DynamoDB session state, least-privilege IAM, a Bedrock Guardrail (AWS-topic scoping + content
  filters + PII redaction), observability + budget alarm — all in Terraform, with GitHub Actions CI.

## Quickstart (local)
```bash
cp .env.example .env          # set AWS_PROFILE + region (no secrets stored)
make install                  # venv (py3.12) + deps
make smoke                    # Bedrock converse check (confirms model access)
make dev                      # FastAPI chat server on :8080
# then:
curl -N localhost:8080/api/chat -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session_id":"s1","message":"How do I enable S3 versioning with the AWS CLI?"}'
```

## Layout
```
backend/    FastAPI app (Strands agent + MCP client + Bedrock) — runs locally and on Lambda
infra/      Terraform: modules/{ecr,lambda,apigw,cognito,dynamodb,guardrail,frontend,observability}
            + envs/dev. The chat UI is modules/frontend/assets/index.html.tftpl (templated → S3).
docs/       architecture + rationale
```

## Configuration
All via env (see `.env.example`): `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID` (default the Sonnet 4.6 global inference profile;
swap to Opus 4.8 in one line), `AWS_REGION`, `AGENT_MAX_TOKENS`/`AGENT_MAX_TOOL_ITERATIONS`
(cost/latency guards), `CONVERSATIONS_TABLE` (DynamoDB; empty = in-memory for local), `AUTH_ENABLED`
+ Cognito ids.

## Deploying & updating

Terraform provisions **all infrastructure**, but it pins the Lambda to the `…:latest` image **tag**,
so it does not build/push the image or redeploy code on its own. The flows:

**First-time deploy** (or fresh account)
```bash
# 0. one-time bootstrap (state backend lives outside this stack, by design):
#    create S3 bucket yy-awsdocs-tfstate-<acct> + DynamoDB lock table yy-awsdocs-tflock
# 1. secrets/config:
cp .env.example .env                       # set AWS_PROFILE, AWS_REGION
echo 'TF_VAR_demo_password=<pick-one>' >> .env   # demo user password (gitignored)
# 2. build + push the container image so the Lambda has something to run:
set -a; source .env; set +a
REPO=$(cd infra/envs/dev && terraform output -raw ecr_repository_url 2>/dev/null || echo "<after first apply>")
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin "${REPO%/*}"
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t "${REPO}:latest" backend && docker push "${REPO}:latest"
# 3. apply. Cognito callback URLs need the CloudFront domain, so it's a two-pass apply:
make tf-apply                              # 1st pass creates CloudFront
#   → copy the app_url into infra/envs/dev/dev.tfvars (callback_urls / logout_urls)
make tf-apply                              # 2nd pass wires Cognito to the real URL
```

**Ship a backend code change** (Terraform won't notice a same-tag image)
```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
REPO=315311531132.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/yy-awsdocs-backend
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t "${REPO}:latest" backend && docker push "${REPO}:latest"
aws lambda update-function-code --function-name yy-awsdocs-api --image-uri "${REPO}:latest"
```

**Ship a frontend change** (the UI is an S3 object behind CloudFront)
```bash
make tf-apply                              # re-uploads index.html (etag is content-hashed)
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id <id> --paths "/" "/index.html"
```

> CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) gates every PR with ruff + pytest + `terraform validate` (no AWS
> creds). `deploy.yml` automates the build/push/apply above via GitHub OIDC; if the account blocks
> the OIDC provider, use the local commands here. ⚠️ In zsh write `${REPO}:latest` (braces) — bare
> `$REPO:latest` triggers the `:l` history modifier and silently mangles the tag.

## Cost
On-demand only: Bedrock per-token (Sonnet 4.6 by default), Lambda per-invocation, DynamoDB on-demand,
CloudFront/S3 negligible at rest. A Budgets alarm is provisioned. `make tf-destroy` tears it down.

## Status
- [x] **M0** — account verified (315311531132 / us-east-1), permissions probed, Bedrock access confirmed
- [x] **M1** — agent core: Bedrock + AWS-Docs MCP, streaming, multi-turn memory, tests (local-first)
- [x] **M2** — deployed: ECR/Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Cognito, CloudFront, IAM, observability;
  end-to-end authenticated chat verified live (Function URL → API Gateway pivot due to org guardrail)
- [x] **M3** — polish: Bedrock Guardrail (AWS-topic scoping + content/PII filters) applied on every
  invocation and verified live; GitHub Actions CI (lint + test + `terraform validate`) + manual
  OIDC deploy workflow

> Runs in a **shared exam account** — every resource is namespaced `yy-awsdocs-*` and only
